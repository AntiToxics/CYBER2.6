Author: Gilad Elran
Program name: server.py
Description:
    This program implements a TCP server that listens for client requests
    and responds based on a 4-character command.

    Supported commands:
        • TIME - returns the current server time.
        • NAME - returns the server name.
        • RAND - returns a random number between 1 and 10.
        • EXIT - disconnects the client.
    The server runs continuously and handles one client at a time.
    When a client sends the EXIT command, the server disconnects from the client and is ready to connecct with another client.
